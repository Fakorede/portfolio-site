**Ekaabo! Welcome! Bienvenue!** üòÉ


‚ÄúWherever you are, and whatever you do, be in love.‚Äù - Rumi

Call me [Fab](). I am an incoming CS PhD student at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Louisiana State University (LSU), fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Umar Farooq](https://csc.lsu.edu/~ufarooq/). My current research focuses on developing a static analysis tool for identifying and preserving app state in Javascript source code.

Previously, I completed my BSc in Computer Science at the Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta, Nigeria, supervised by [Prof. Sodiya](https://funaab.edu.ng/staff/sodiya-adesina-simon/) and [Prof. (Mrs.) Onashoga](https://funaab.edu.ng/dr-mrs-onashoga-saidat-adebukola-nee-okunlaya/). I've worked as a Software Engineer at [ARM Pensions PFA](https://armpension.com/), [Cadanapay](https://cadanapay.com/) and [Infiuss Health](https://infiuss.com/).


My primary research interests center on the fields of Software Engineering and Programming Languages, with a specific commitment to addressing real-world challenges encountered in the creation of web and mobile applications. Additionally, my interest extends to the utilization of Program Analysis, which involves a thorough examination of source code to better understand its behavior, identify problems, and extract valuable insights. 
<!-- I'm equally intrigued by Program Synthesis, a domain that strives to automate software development, reducing human effort while ensuring correctness.  -->

<!-- Furthermore, I have a keen interest in crafting systems that harness the synergy between Software Engineering and cutting-edge Deep Learning techniques to effectively tackle challenges within these research domains. -->
