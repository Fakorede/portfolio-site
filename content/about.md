### Hi, 👋🏾

[//]: # '{{ < figure src="/images/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar" class="right-aligned" >}}'

I'm Fab, a 22 y/o Software Developer based in Nigeria.

I always try to be open to learning new languages and frameworks depending on the need of the project. I thrive to learning about software development best practices and apply them to my work.

I’m passionate about the process of software development, such as the documentation, testing, code reviews, communicating with peers within teams, thinking about solutions to problems, etc.

I find very interesting participating in projects from its very beginning to end, and seeing it culminate in a final product while contributing in every way I can.

### 🎓 Education

I graduated with a Bachelors of **Computer Science** in 2019 from [Federal University Abeokuta](https://unaab.edu.ng/).

### 💼 Work

I’m currently working as a Software Developer at [](https://acetechsolutions.com.ng/). During my undergraduate degree, I interned at [Mayconcepts Solutions](https://www.mayconceptsolutions.com/), a digital agency based in Lagos and went to intern in another startup, [Tested Technologies](https://testedtechs.com/), where I contributed mostly to their web platforms.
