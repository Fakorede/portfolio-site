      <description>Hi, 👋🏾 I&amp;rsquo;m Fab, a 22 y/o Software Developer based in Nigeria.
I always try to be open to learning new languages and frameworks depending on the need of the project. I thrive to learning about software development best practices and apply them to my work.
I’m passionate about the process of software development, such as the documentation, testing, code reviews, communicating with peers within teams, thinking about solutions to problems, etc.</description>
